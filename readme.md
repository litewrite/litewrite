# [Litewrite](http://litewrite.net)
**unobtrusive writing** by [Jan-Christoph Borchardt](http://jancborchardt.net) & [Jorin Vogel](http://jorin-vogel.com)

## Contribute

Play with the [development version](http://litewrite.github.com/litewrite), check out [issues](http://github.com/litewrite/litewrite/issues) and dive into the code if you like. Set up your development environment:

1. git clone http://github.com/litewrite/litewrite
2. Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/#download)
3. Install grunt gobally via (`sudo `)`npm install -g grunt-cli`
4. Run `npm install` to install the development dependencies
5. `grunt` to start a web server at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Building the production version

Run `grunt build`. But keep attention because it overwrites the existing files.

## Remotestorage

This is an [unhosted web app](http://unhosted.org), meaning its code is fully client-side, without any server backend you need to trust! It also supports the open [remotestorage](http://remotestorage.io) protocol so you can sync your data across devices & browsers.
